# House Price Prediction Model
I have successfully completed a project focused on predicting house prices in the Bengaluru region. To accomplish this, I utilized Google Colab, a cloud-based platform that allows for easy implementation and execution of Python code. The project involved gathering a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of houses in the Bengaluru area, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, amenities, and other relevant features.

I then proceeded to preprocess the data, which included steps like handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and performing feature engineering to extract valuable information from the existing attributes. This process aimed to ensure that the data was in a suitable format for training a machine learning model.

For the actual house price prediction, I employed a machine learning algorithm, likely regression-based methods, which are well-suited for predicting continuous numerical values. The model was trained on a portion of the dataset and validated on another segment to assess its performance. I fine-tuned the model's hyperparameters to optimize its predictive capabilities.

To evaluate the model's accuracy and generalization, I utilized various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics allowed me to measure the extent of the model's predictions' deviation from the actual house prices.

After achieving satisfactory results, I deployed the trained model to make predictions on new and unseen data. This step involved handling any potential scaling and normalization issues in the input data.

Finally, I compiled the entire project into a coherent and well-documented report, highlighting the methodology, data preprocessing steps, model training process, evaluation metrics, and the performance achieved. Additionally, I might have shared insights and observations about influential factors affecting house prices in the Bengaluru region.

Throughout the project, I likely utilized various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, model training, and visualization purposes.

In summary, the project on house price prediction in the Bengaluru region was executed on Google Colab using Python. The process involved data collection, preprocessing, machine learning model training, evaluation, and reporting of the results.
